			<h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
			<p>Welcome to the landing page of the Sons of Nuggle. We are a group who have devoted our lives to the worship of Nuggle, who we believe to be the embodiment of nihilism and chaos. We await the return of our master and to usher in a new world order countering the norm and creating a new world of enlightenment.

				Our lore dates back to ancient times, when the world was ruled by many. In those times, Nuggle was worshipped by many, and his power was unmatched. But as time passed, the world became more civilized, and people turned away from the worship of Nuggle. The deity grew angry and vengeful, and withdrew from the world, leaving behind only a prophecy that one day he would return to exact his revenge.
				
				And so we wait, with bated breath, for the return of Nuggle. We believe that his first child, a giant, violent baby known as "Baby", will herald his arrival. Baby is our most revered disciple, and we believe that he is the key to unlocking the secrets of Nuggle's return.
				
				Our cult is shrouded in secrecy, and we are constantly on the lookout for new recruits who share our beliefs. We meet in hidden locations, performing dark rituals and chanting ancient incantations in attempts to summon Nuggle and his minions. We believe that only through the destruction of everything can we achieve true enlightenment.
				
				Our members come from all walks of life, united only by our unwavering devotion to Nuggle. Some of us are scholars, delving into the ancient texts and prophecies to uncover new insights into Nuggle's power. Others are warriors, ready to do battle with anyone who stands in our way. And still, we are simply lost souls, searching for meaning in a world that is lost.
				
				If you are interested in joining us, we welcome you with open arms. But be warned - our path is not an easy one, and our beliefs may challenge everything you thought you knew about the world. But if you are willing to embrace the darkness and the chaos, and to give yourself over completely to Nuggle, then you may find the enlightenment that you seek.</p>
